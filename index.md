## Larger Projects (All still works in progress)

### PyBrowser

An attempt at a web browser written in as pure Python as possible, combining three projects so far:

  - [Browser](https://github.com/User0332/pybrowser) - the web browser itself
  - [DomAPI](https://github.com/User0332/domapi) - a library that allows strings of HTML to be parsed and modified as document objects
  - [JS Object Explorer/lightweight-objbrowser](https://github.com/User0332/lightweight-objbrowser) - a library that allows Python dicts to be viewed in a dropdown-menu format (using tkinter)

### UntypedScript

Currently still a work in progress, [UntypedScript](https://github.com/User0332/UntypedScript) aims to be a typeless, easy-to-write language with speeds comparable to that of C.

### FakeOS

[A simulation of an operating system written in pure Python](https://github.com/User0332/FakeOS).

## Python Web Tools

### WebPy

A web framework using Flask that allows the developer to use filesystem routes and reduce the amount of Python code needed for the application. WebPy now offers integration with PyX files!

  - [Framework](https://github.com/User0332/webpy)
  - [Example Application](https://github.com/User0332/webpy-app)

### ScriptLess

[ScriptLess](https://github.com/User0332/ScriptLess) lets you execute JavaScript "from the server side", but be prepared to face a ton of bugs! Also - most of the WebAPI class implementations, like Document, are still empty.



### PySite/PyX

Like JSX but in Python - [PyX](https://github.com/User0332/pyx) is probably still really buggy!
